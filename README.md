# Plain TODO list

TODO lists seem to be ubiquitous in the Javascript ecosystem. Yet, I have never wrote one. It is my intuition that framework & library devs assume that everybody has an experience writing a TODO lists. Many documentations use TODO list code for illustration purposes. I hope that after writing this plain TODO list, my documentation reading skills will hence improve.
